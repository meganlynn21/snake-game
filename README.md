# snake-game
I made this snake game using React. I implemented Linked Lists and Reversed Linked Lists.

**Objective**
Get to 10 points to win, if you hit the wall or end up hitting your own tail then it is game over.


**You can play it live here in netlify at this link:** https://cool-cajeta-5a23c8.netlify.app/


**How to Play**
* Press the Start Button to start the game
* Use arrow keys to move the snake
* Eat the red squares which are food and the snake grows longer
* When you eat the purple food, it will reverse the linked list and make the snake go backwards 
* I made it easy, will add more difficulties in the future but for now for testing if you get a score of 10 then you win
